Needs to be cleaned up as follows
change each line to be in the format
year, name <email>

i.e. somelines have the format name <email>, year,year2,year3 so the years need to be swapped to the year, name <email> format

Then where there are several of the same "name <email>" the year needs to be amalgamated 

e.g. if we have 
2001, name <email>
2002, 2004,2010, name <email>

then create just one line of
2001-2010, name <email>

Finally, where we have a unique name <email> then the <email> should be deleted

e.g.

freddy kruger <somewhere@gmail.com>
freddy kruger <somewhereelese@gmail.com>

Then these are treated as unique - so both should be kept
where we have

freddy h kruger <somewhere@gmail.com>
freddy b kruger <somewhereelse@gmail.com>

Then we can delete the email address for both since there are two "different freddy krugers"
